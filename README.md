## Needed permisisons
Please note that correct permissions are needed to run this application, so either run this tool as `sudo` or adjust your `udev` rules.

### UDEV settings (ubuntu)
To allow your user to access the ReSpeaker USB device (Vendor ID 2886, Product ID 0018) without root, create a udev rule:

Create the rule file:
``` 
sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-respeaker.rules
```
Paste this line:
```
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2886", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0018", MODE="0666"
```
Save and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X).

Reload udev rules and replug the device:
```
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
```

Now you can run your app as a normal user.
